## About me
Hello everyone! My name is Virinchi, and this is my portfolio.<br>
I am a Business Analytics Major at Isenberg School of Management. I honed my cloud infrastructure skills as a DevOps Engineer over 2 years. Simultaneously, I led the marketing of a nationwide NGO dedicated to empowering underprivileged students in India. During my tenure there, I achieved a groundbreaking increase in newsletter signups by 62% to reach 9000 subscribers in just one year. an experience that emphasized the power of data-driven decisions. My Academic journey has fortified my knowledge of data-driven strategy, marketing analytics, and optimization techniques. Furthermore, I am proficient in advanced Excel, Google Analytics, and visualization tools.<br>
I am both a team player and a decisive leader. Currently, I am most interested in marketing analytics because of its highly volatile trends and recent technological advancements.<br>

### Sonar (Rocks vs. Mines) 
**Description:** The dataset, sourced from the XYZ website, encompasses two files: "sonar.mines" and "sonar.rocks." It contains a total of 111 patterns from sonar signals bounced off metal cylinders and 97 patterns from rocks, gathered under similar conditions. Each pattern comprises 60 numbers indicating energy within frequency bands over time, with labels "R" for rocks and "M" for mines, sorted by aspect angles. These files are consolidated into one dataset named "sonar.all-data." After meticulous data preprocessing and feature engineering, the logistic regression model was fine-tuned to optimize its predictive capabilities. With an R-squared value of 0.81, indicating the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model, and an accuracy rate of 88%, the logistic regression model demonstrated robustness in distinguishing between rocks and mines based on the sonar data patterns.<br>
