## About me
I am a Business Analytics Major at Isenberg School of Management. I honed my cloud infrastructure skills as a DevOps Engineer over 2 years. Simultaneously, I led the marketing of a nationwide NGO dedicated to empowering underprivileged students in India. During my tenure there, I achieved a groundbreaking increase in newsletter signups by 62% to reach 9000 subscribers in just one year. an experience that emphasized the power of data-driven decisions. My Academic journey has fortified my knowledge of data-driven strategy, marketing analytics, and optimization techniques. Furthermore, I am proficient in advanced Excel, Google Analytics, and visualization tools.<br>
I am both a team player and a decisive leader.<br>

You can see more information in my [**CV**](https://github.com/almostoutlier/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Virinchi%20Alahari%20Resume.pdf).

This repository was created to showcase my analytical and technical skills (Excel, Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, PowerPoint, and others).


## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of projects with brief descriptions.

### ATS Optimized Custom Resume Generator
**Description:** 
- Utilizes the `python-docx` library and the Gemini API to create professional, ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimized resumes in the Microsoft Word format.
- Analyzes job descriptions with the Gemini API to generate tailored resumes with optimized content and keyword placement, ensuring a high ATS score.
- Takes user inputs for personal information, education, experience, skills, and academic projects to generate well-structured, visually appealing resumes.
- Optimizes resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems using industry-standard formatting, section headings, and keywords extracted from job descriptions.
- Presents education and experience sections in a tabular format with adjustable column widths and appropriate formatting for readability.<br>

**Tech Stack:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** python-docx, Gemini API
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

### Sonar
**Description:** 
- Dataset sourced from the Archive ICS UCI  website, encompassing two files: "sonar.mines" and "sonar.rocks."
- Contains 111 patterns from sonar signals bounced off metal cylinders and 97 patterns from rocks, gathered under similar conditions.
- Each pattern comprises 60 numbers indicating energy within frequency bands over time, labeled "R" for rocks and "M" for mines, sorted by aspect angles.
- Files are consolidated into one dataset named "sonar.all-data."
- After meticulous data preprocessing and feature engineering, the logistic regression model was fine-tuned, achieving an R-squared value of 0.81 and an accuracy rate of 88%, demonstrating robustness in distinguishing between rocks and mines based on sonar data patterns.<br>

**Tech Stack:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset:** <a href = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/151/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs+rocks">

### Social Distancing Monitor
**Description:** 
- Employ YOLOv3, pretrained on the COCO dataset, for object detection.
- YOLO offers speed advantages despite being potentially less accurate than two-stage detectors.
- Treats object detection as a regression problem, predicting bounding box coordinates and class label probabilities simultaneously.
- Returns person prediction probabilities, bounding box coordinates, and centroids.
- Applies non-maxima suppression (NMS) to reduce overlapping bounding boxes.
- Computes centroids of detections and analyzes pairwise distances to identify people within a certain pixel distance threshold.<br>

**Tech Stack:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** YOLOv3
- **Pretrained Model:** COCO dataset
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy
- **Techniques:** Non-maxima suppression (NMS)

## Acadamic Projects
This section contains a list of projects which are a part of my acadamics with brief descriptions.

### Flight Delay Prediction 
**Description:** 
- Dataset includes information about flights in three modules: Airlines, Airports, and Flights.
- All required data is present in the "Flights" module, including flight details, departure and arrival airports, delays, cancellations, and reasons.
- Using this data to predict the status of the flight and the corresponding reason.
- Objectives:
  - Predict if a flight will be on time, delayed, or cancelled.(Multiclass Classification Model)
